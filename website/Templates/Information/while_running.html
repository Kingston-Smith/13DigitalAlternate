    <h3>During a run</h3>
    <br/><br/>
    <h4>Temperature control</h4>
    <p>
        Ideally, while doing a run, you want to be in a reasonably cold area, this is for a multitude of reasons including just general well being, it's not great to be sweating too much
    </p>
    <br/><br/>
    <h4>Skips</h4>
    <p>
        There are a multitude of skips throughout the game
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Crime scene/Monarch skip</h5>
    <p>
        This is a two part skip which skips two individual segments in the gotham segment of the game<br/>
        <br/>
        Part 1: Crime scene skip<br/>
        <br/>
        After going behind the bookshelf in Shrikes appartment, you will be forced into a crime scene, Batman will refuse to use the exit vent until you complete the crime scene.<br/>
        Walk up to the vent, and try to forward mantle onto it, then when you start rapidly vibrating, attempt to initiate glides and cape stuns,<br/>
        This will cause batman to move through the closed vent cover into the vent. Continue as normal until you reach the monarch theatre<br/>
        <br/>
        Part 2: Monarch skip<br/>
        <br/>
        Upon arriving at the overlook from Monarch theatre, you may notice the rats and the door to the theatre (which is a cutscene trigger), glide to the gate on the left side, stick your head through, and grapple,<br/>
        You should get flung backwards, after that open the gate and grapple up to the top. Turn around and glide against the fence behind you,<br/>
        This should cause you to move upwards to the roof.<br/>
        Turn around and walk on the fence you used to get up, then glide against the wall, falling into an oob area. Wait for the floor to deload and then glide into the visible door
    </p>
